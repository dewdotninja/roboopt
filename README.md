This repo is intended to keep my adventure in the area of robotics and optimization. I start it from scratch, so you might want 
to get back later when there's some materials available.

Right now I am gathering information from Youtube

### Motivation

Almost all of my control system experiences result in controllers with fixed coefficients. I have not heard of solving 
some optimization problem during sampling instant, until this era when computer performance makes it possible. 
So this direction is new and fastinating to me.
